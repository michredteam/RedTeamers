# Reflective DLL Injection

This directory for tools to test Reflective DLL Injection.

| Project | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [ReflectiveInjector](./ReflectiveInjector) | This is a tool for testing Reflective DLL Injection. |
| [ReflectiveLib](./ReflectiveLib) | This is a DLL for testing Reflective DLL Injection. The entry point for reflection is named as `ReflectiveEntry`. |

To avoid memory error, `ReflectiveLib` must be build without stack cookie.
x86 and x64 are supported.

## ReflectiveInjector

IF you want to inject reflective DLL to other process, must be specifies the target PID (`-p` option), path for reflective DLL (`-d` option) and reflective loader function's name (`-e` option):

```
C:\Dev>.\ReflectiveInjector.exe -d .\ReflectiveLib.dll -e ReflectiveEntry -p 10100

[>] Reading reflective DLL.
    [*] Path : C:\Dev\ReflectiveLib.dll
[>] Trying to search export function offset.
    [*] Export Function : ReflectiveEntry
    [*] Architecture    : AMD64
[+] Offset for ReflectiveEntry is 0x5A0
[>] Trying to open the target process.
    [*] Process ID   : 10100
    [*] Process Name : Notepad
[+] Got a target process handle.
    [*] Process Handle : 0x2D0
[>] Trying to allocate DLL memory to the target process.
[+] Allocated 11776 bytes memory to the target process.
    [*] DLL Buffer      @ 0x000002636AB90000
    [*] Export Function @ 0x000002636AB905A0
[>] Trying to write 11776 bytes DLL data to the target process.
[+] 11776 bytes DLL data is written in the target process.
[>] Making DLL data buffer to readable and executable.
[+] Memory protection is updated successfully.
[+] Trying to create DLL function thread.
[+] DLL function's thread is started successfully.
    [*] Thread Handle : 0x2DC
[*] Done.
```

![load](./figures/inject.png)

To load reflective DLL into `ReflectiveInjector`'s process, only specify path for reflective DLL (`-d` option) and reflective loader function's name (`-e` option):

```
C:\Dev>.\ReflectiveInjector.exe -d .\ReflectiveLib.dll -e ReflectiveEntry

[>] Reading reflective DLL.
    [*] Path : C:\Dev\ReflectiveLib.dll
[>] Trying to search export function offset.
    [*] Export Function : ReflectiveEntry
    [*] Architecture    : AMD64
[+] Offset for ReflectiveEntry is 0x5A0
[>] Trying to load reflective DLL to this process.
[>] Making DLL data buffer to readable and executable.
[+] Memory protection is updated successfully.
[+] Trying to create DLL function thread.
[+] DLL function's thread is started successfully.
    [*] Thread Handle : 0x2DC
[*] Done.
